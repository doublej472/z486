"""Apply z486 microcode optimizations to the extracted 80386 CROM.

`ucode_base.hex` is the original 37-bit extracted microcode and is NEVER edited.
This script applies the documented PATCHES below and writes the optimized
40-bit `ucode.hex` (+ `ucode.mif`): the native word remains in bits 36:0 and
the D2 early kind occupies bits 39:37. This script also owns the hardwired
common-instruction recipe inventory and
generates its SystemVerilog lookup and human-readable manifest, so microcode
words and the recipes that consume them cannot silently drift apart.

37-bit word field layout:
    bus[5:0]  sub[7:6]  op[10:8]  aluop[17:11]  src[23:18]  dst[30:24]  alusrc[36:31]
